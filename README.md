# WiFi Share v2.0 — WiFi Tethering via WiFi Direct + Proxy

Share your WiFi internet with other devices on Android 6 (no SIM card needed).

## How It Works
```
[Router] ──WiFi──► [Your Android 6 Phone]
                          │
                    WiFi Direct (P2P)
                          │
                   [Other Device] ──proxy──► internet ✓
```

Your phone stays connected to your router via normal WiFi.
It simultaneously creates a **WiFi Direct group** (a second virtual hotspot).
A built-in **HTTP/HTTPS proxy server** (port 8282) routes traffic from
connected devices through your phone to the internet.
